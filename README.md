##Overview

This project is a fully automated Python-based data cleaning pipeline for CSV datasets using Pandas and NumPy. It addresses common data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistent text data, outliers, and anomalies with minimal manual intervention.

##Features:

Missing value imputation

Text normalization

Outlier detection

Anomaly flagging

End-to-end automated processing

##Validation

The cleaning results were validated using OpenRefine as a reference tool to verify improvements in data consistency and quality. The pipeline produces stable numeric distributions and improves overall data reliability.

##Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, OpenRefine

##Use Cases

Data preprocessing for machine learning

Reusable data cleaning for CSV datasets

Scalability

The solution is scalable, reproducible, and suitable for integration into production data workflows.
